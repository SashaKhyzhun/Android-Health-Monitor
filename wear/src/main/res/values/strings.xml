        Protection Act CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
        and online services to post a privacy policy. The law\'s reach stretches well beyond
        California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
        that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
        consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
        being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.
        - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

        You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:

        (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) When it comes to the collection of personal
        information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children\'s Online Privacy
        Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States\'
        consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
        websites and online services must do to protect children\'s privacy and safety online. We
        do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. Fair Information
        Practices The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
        United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development
        of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
        Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy
        laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair Information
        Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We
        will notify you via email

        Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
        rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
        requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
        that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
        prosecute non-compliance by data processors. CAN SPAM Act The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that
        sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages,
        gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
        tough penalties for violations. We collect your email address in order to:
        \n• Send
        information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions To be in accordance
        with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
